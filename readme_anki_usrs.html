<b>IGNORE DUPES</b>

By default Anki flags any two cards of the same note type with the same front field as duplicates.

While this functionality usually is very handy, there are a few cases where some tweeks are nescessary: For example one might want to have more than one source deck (e.g. imported from anki web), all of which use the same note type. In this case every word that appears in more than one source deck would be flagged, as well as any words that I added to my normal review deck which appear in one other source deck.
This is of course undesirable.

With this addon the function that checks for duplicates can be tweaked to ignore dupliates based on the decks they belong to. E.g. one could ignore all duplicates where at least one card belongs to a deck with "DUPLICATE" in the name.
